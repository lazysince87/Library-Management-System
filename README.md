        This project is meant to simulate the functions of a library via the use of a Library class. This Library class
        is then used to both store and operate on Textbook and Fiction Book objects (created by their respective classes, and
        also being derived from a general Book class). Using the Library, we can add a book, remove a book, search for a book
        by title or author, display all books, borrow a book, or return a book.

        The concepts this project shows are Vectors, Pointers, Classes & Objects, Class Inheritance, and Exception Handling.
